[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Exercise 4.2 The numbers generated by `random.random` are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability.

>>Generate 1000 numbers from `random.random` and plot their PMF and CDF.
Is the distribution uniform?

>>Here's the code to generate the random numbers & the PMF:

```
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
import scipy.stats

t = [random.random() for i in range(1000)]
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth = 0.05)
thinkplot.Show()

```
>>The plot shows a fairly (but not perfeclty) uniform dispersion of inputs between 0 & 1, each with probabilities of 1 in 1000, as would be expected.

>>The code for the cdf plot:

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show()

```
>>Also, as one would predict, the CDF plot is a slightly bumpy form of the graph y = x.  Sure enough, as one increases n, the cdf gets smoother.  

>>(I tried generating 10 & 10,000 random numbers and plotting the cdf to confirm)
